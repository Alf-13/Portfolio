Here is a collection of project files that are a sample of my work. Also check out my "bakery_sim" repository to see a project that uses embedded SQL in a business simulation.

shape_net: This is a neural net that learns how to tell the difference between a square, triangle, and ellipse when only given the base, height, and area.

xchannel_plot: This processes a stock price chart to determine the boundary channel and the average position based on each point's proximaty to a local maxima or minima.

Tailwind Traders Report: This is a Power Bi dashboard that I made as a capstone project for the Microsoft Power Bi Analyst Certification.

BOOK_MONTE_CARLO: This is a sample Monte Carlo simulation that follows a textbook example (Implementing Derivatives Models, by: Les Clewlow and Chris Strickland).
